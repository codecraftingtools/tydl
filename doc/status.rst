This project is not in a generally useful state at the moment.  It currently
consists of some proof-of-concept utility code and simple, but functional,
example programs that demonstrate the desired C++ *Smart Structure* API.
There is no code generator at this point, but you can see the desired source
specification for some simple data types alongside the C++ code that would be
generated by running a command-line tool.
