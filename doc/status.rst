This project is not in a generally useful state at the moment, but may still
be of some interest nonetheless.  It currently consists of a tutorial,
reference documentation, some proof-of-concept utility code and simple, but
functional, example programs that demonstrate the desired C++ *Smart
Structure* API.  There is no code generator at this point, but you can see
the desired source specification for some simple data types alongside the C++
code that would be generated by running a command-line tool.
