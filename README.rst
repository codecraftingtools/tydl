Tydl
====

Tydl is a type definition language for specifying the structure,
layout, and semantic attributes of data types. This project also aims
to provide a set of tools that can be used to generate documentation
or high-level code from type specifications.

`Tydl`_ is part of the `Code Craftsmen`_ project.  The
`documentation`_ is hosted on `Read the Docs`_ and the `source code`_
can be found on `GitHub`_.
